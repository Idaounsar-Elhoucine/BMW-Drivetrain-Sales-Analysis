🚘 BMW Drivetrain Sales Analysis – Interactive Power BI Dashboard
Welcome to my Power BI project focused on a detailed BMW Drivetrain Sales Analysis!

This dashboard offers a comprehensive look into BMW's sales performance from 2010 to 2024, specifically segmented by Diesel, Electric, Petrol, and Hybrid powertrains. It leverages data visualization and business intelligence to surface actionable insights across various key performance indicators (KPIs) and dimensions.

📊 Project Overview
This project analyzes BMW sales data to understand the performance and trends of different vehicle drivetrains over a 15-year period. The core focus is to answer crucial business questions such as:

Which drivetrain generates the highest total sales revenue?

How have the Electric and Hybrid sales grown compared to traditional Petrol and Diesel?

What are the highest and lowest price points across different vehicle types?

Are there dominant color preferences or transmission types for specific drivetrains?

The dashboard is designed for quick, interactive comparison across the four major drivetrain categories.

🧩 Tools & Techniques
Power BI Desktop – For data modeling and report creation.

Power Query (M Language) – For initial data preparation and transformation.

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Used to create dynamic KPIs and measures displayed on the cards.

Key DAX and visualization techniques include:

Implementing Dynamic Filters using top-of-page selection buttons to switch between Diesel, Electric, Petrol, and Hybrid views.

Utilizing Card Visuals for prominent display of Sales Revenue, Highest Price, and Lowest Price.

Creating a Clean and Consistent Aesthetic using a dark theme to enhance data readability.

⚙️ Data Insights & Visualization Highlights
The raw sales data was transformed and modeled to support the following analytical views:

💰 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The dashboard prominently displays three key metrics for the selected drivetrain:

Total Sales (in Millions): Revealing the overall revenue generated.

Highest Price: Identifying the most expensive model sold in that category (e.g., $120K for Electric).

Lowest Price: Showing the entry-level price point (e.g., $30K for Diesel).

📈 Sales Trends & Distribution
Sales by Year (Bar Chart): Provides an immediate, year-over-year trend view to assess growth, stability, or decline for the selected drivetrain (visible in the top-right corner).

Sales by Color (Bar Chart): Highlights the most popular vehicle colors for a specific fuel type, indicating clear consumer preferences (e.g., Red and White are top for Petrol).

Sales by Transmission (Donut Chart): Shows the sales distribution between different transmission types (Manual/Automatic) with clear percentage splits.

Car Price By Model & Year (Bar Chart): Tracks how the average price of cars in the selected category has trended over the years.

🚗 Model Exploration
A clear visual gallery allows users to Select Model Type (i3, M3, X3, etc.) to apply cross-filtering and view specific model performance within the chosen drivetrain category.

🧠 Key Insights Uncovered
By easily toggling between the four views, the dashboard highlights several critical findings:

Revenue Leadership: Hybrid sales currently lead in total revenue at $64.53M, closely followed by Petrol and Electric.

Price Consistency: The Highest Price point remains stable at around $120K across most drivetrains, suggesting similar high-end model positioning.

Drivetrain Preference: The Electric and Hybrid categories show sales totals that are highly competitive with, or even surpassing, the traditional Diesel and Petrol categories, signaling a rapid market shift.

Transmission Dominance: Across all four views, the 50.1-51.0% segment consistently dominates the Sales by Transmission chart, indicating a strong preference for one specific transmission type.

🚀 Conclusion
The BMW Drivetrain Sales Analysis Dashboard is a powerful example of transforming segmented operational data into a clear, comparative, and actionable data story. It demonstrates proficiency in Power BI design, advanced DAX logic for metric calculation, and the ability to create visualizations that support strategic decision-making in a rapidly evolving automotive market.
